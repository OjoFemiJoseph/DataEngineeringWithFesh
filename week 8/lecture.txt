Data Engineering Week 8 (MongoDB Change Stream)

How do you connect to your source system (your company's ERP, a streaming API etc)?

Well, let's look at some code!

This content is taken from the MongoDB University. Comments are mine though. I believe going through the comments on each of the 5 screenshots will tell the story of what is happening at each turn.

- 0. Initialize models and make d db connection
- 1. Create items and quantities in an inventory collection (table) to sell from later.
- 2. Open a change stream against the collection and print out all the changes that occur.
- 3. Simulate a continuous selling (typically from an app for eg) of item by reducing the value/quantities of items on the table.
- 4. Another connection to the change stream, but here, we have a pipeline checking for a low threshold: 20 from the initial 100.

As a data engineer, this is one of the ways you can continuously move data from a source system to another. As the changes come through, you are processing them and loading in another system or vice versa.

Now, to prepare for possible errors, something you cannot run away from, there a number of other things to add to the pipeline. An important one is keeping a log of time of changes. This helps you know when things broke, and where to go back and recover from.
